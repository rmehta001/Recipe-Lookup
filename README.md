# Recipe-Lookup
This is a React project based on API interaction . The user types in a prime ingredient for their dish. After clicking the search button, a plethora of recipes for the same appear. Then the user clicks on their favorite recipe and the page redirects to a full description of the recipe and possibly a video too! For example, try searching mango.
I am still working on the project. There are still many improvements needed. For example, I want to employ selecting one or more ingredients in so that the user can obtain a more specific recipe. 
The application is hosted online. Follow this link to open the app.
